Thoughts from @joshmock on Redux/Flux:
> The thing that I think helps explain it to others, personally, is that
React and Flux are two sides of a coin: Flux stores all your state, React
represents it on the page. Redux's implementation of Flux basically mirrors how
React works: React uses cascading components to display and act on state in the
DOM; Redux uses cascading functions to store and update state through basic data
structures.  It's just two trees. One in the DOM, one in a series of composed
functions.
